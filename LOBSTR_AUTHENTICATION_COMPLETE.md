## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 🔄 **Authentication Flow**

#### **First Time Setup** (Seed phrase shown ONCE)
1. User creates/restores wallet with seed phrase
2. System displays 24-word BIP39 mnemonic for backup
3. User sets up 6-digit PIN 
4. Seed phrase encrypted with PBKDF2 + AES-GCM
5. Encrypted data stored in browser localStorage
6. Optional biometric authentication setup

#### **Daily Access** (PIN only - no seed phrase)
1. User opens wallet application
2. System detects encrypted wallet in storage
3. PIN unlock interface presented
4. User enters 6-digit PIN
5. System decrypts seed phrase using PIN
6. Wallet loads with full functionality
7. **No seed phrase entry required**

#### **Recovery Flow** (New device/PIN forgotten)
1. User selects "Use Seed Phrase Instead" 
2. User enters their backed-up seed phrase
3. System validates BIP39 mnemonic
4. User sets new 6-digit PIN
5. New encrypted storage created
6. Wallet restored with new PIN access

### 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

#### **Core Components**
- **`EncryptedWalletStorage`**: Complete encryption/decryption system
- **`HDWallet`**: Static methods for wallet authentication
- **`WalletOverview`**: Main UI controller with authentication flow
- **`PinSetup`**: PIN creation with biometric option
- **`PinUnlock`**: Daily PIN entry interface

#### **Security Features**
- **Encryption**: PBKDF2 (100K iterations) + AES-GCM-256
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (encrypted data only)
- **Memory**: Secure wiping of all sensitive data
- **Biometrics**: WebAuthn platform authenticator support
- **Attempts**: PIN attempt limiting (5 attempts max)

## 🧪 TESTING & VERIFICATION

### 📱 **Manual Testing Steps**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/crypto-wallet`
2. Create new wallet → verify seed phrase display (24 words)
3. Set up PIN → confirm encryption and storage
4. **Refresh page** → should show PIN unlock (not seed phrase)
5. Enter PIN → wallet loads without seed phrase entry
6. Test recovery → "Use Seed Phrase Instead" → restore flow

### 🔍 **Browser Testing**  
- Test page available: `http://localhost:5173/test-lobstr-auth.html`  
- WebCrypto API compatibility verified
- WebAuthn biometric support detected
- localStorage encryption confirmed

### ✅ **Verification Results**
- ✅ Seed phrase entered only once during setup
- ✅ Daily access via PIN only (no seed phrase prompts)
- ✅ Recovery requires seed phrase + new PIN setup
- ✅ Biometric authentication works on supported devices
- ✅ All sensitive data properly encrypted and wiped
- ✅ Professional UI/UX matching Lobstr standards
