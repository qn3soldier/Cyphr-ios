# P2P Network Deployment Guide

## Test Results Summary
- Overall Score: 59.1%
- Total Peers Tested: 5
- Connections Established: 4
- Messages Processed: 228

## Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] Peer discovery mechanisms tested
- [ ] Message delivery reliability verified
- [ ] Network resilience confirmed
- [ ] Security features validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Deployment Recommendations
1. Start with 5 peers for initial rollout
2. Monitor connection success rates (target: >90%)
3. Track message delivery performance (target: <500ms avg)
4. Implement automated failover testing
5. Set up security monitoring for traffic patterns

## Configuration Parameters
```json
{
  "maxConnections": 50,
  "preferredConnections": 5,
  "connectionTimeout": 5000,
  "retryAttempts": 3,
  "keepAliveInterval": 30000,
  "obfuscationEnabled": true,
  "adaptiveMode": true
}
```

## Monitoring Metrics
- Connection success rate: Monitor hourly
- Message delivery rate: Monitor in real-time
- Network partition events: Alert immediately
- Memory usage: Monitor continuously
- Security anomalies: Alert on detection
