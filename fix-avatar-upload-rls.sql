-- Fix avatar upload RLS policies
-- Problem: Conflicting policies and auth.role() vs get_current_user_id()

-- Drop the conflicting policy that uses Supabase auth
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload avatars" ON storage.objects;

-- Keep only the custom auth policy but make it more permissive for testing
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload own avatars" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload avatars" ON storage.objects

    WITH CHECK (
        bucket_id = 'avatars'

            get_current_user_id() IS NOT NULL 
            AND get_current_user_id() <> ''
            OR
